# 📝 My Notes App

A simple and modern **notes application** built with:

- ⚛️ **React** + **TypeScript**
- 🎨 **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- 🗄️ **Supabase** for authentication and database (my first time using Supabase 🚀)

The app allows users to **sign up, log in, and manage their personal notes** in real-time with CRUD operations.
